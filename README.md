MSCH-C220 Final Project | PUSH THE BUTTON

\## Theme

Pushing buttons is fun! I wanted to see how many ways I could extrapolate the sheer joy of pressing buttons in as many ways as possible



\## Game Play

Objective:


Control a character using the WASD keys, and the space key, to push buttons! You might need to use objects in the level to press buttons, or to get to higher places. You might even need to push multiple buttons to complete the level.

Game-play instructions

WASD | Move

Space Bar | Jump
R | Restart Level 

\## What did you 

Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game



Honestly did not struggle with much. Outside of keeping track of time, I think the hardest part of the development was simply making a modular level system. The way the game is programmed allows me to make levels REALLY FAST because everything is simply a prefab that works with each other to make the game run. Buttons create trackers on the menu automagically and transition between levels.



\## Implementation

Features

* Character controller
* Button pressing action
* Sounds!
* Music!
* UI with animations
* Lots of juiciness (particles included)	
* About 5-15 minutes worth of playtime

Assets, or resources used

Sounds are from Soundly

Music is from Meldy (IOS App)

Character controller is from that one project we did a few months ago

Everything else is made by me.



\## Special Focus

What is your special focus?

What did you do for it? How would you rate your own effort? 1-5. (I will agree or disagree with this sentiment, but I want to know what you thought)



5



I really like how the game turned out. Buttons make mechanical sounds when they are activated and deactivated, You make sounds when you jump, the boxes in the game make noises and change the volume of the sound depending on the collision force. The UI and screen transitions  blend nicely together. You have a trail which adds double satisfaction points. I can go on



Point is, I worked hard to make the game feel REALLY good. I like it, I enjoy it. So much so that after it. I am putting this on itch.io because it is a GREAT portfolio piece! PUSHING BUTTONS IS FUN? NO WAY!!!
